# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
In this guided project we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We'll perform many data cleaning tasks on employee exit surveys to be able to analyze if employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time are resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction.
